# Bloom

## Inspiration

Using blockchain technology to help securely store patient data and to authorise access to providers from your fingertips. We saw a purpose in ensuring that patient information is easy to access, full control over patient information is essential and transmision of sensitivie information secure.

## What it does

We have built a web application that allows patients to approve access to medical records stored securely in our own private blockchain run by healthcare providers.

## How we built it

Using NodeJS, Express, PouchDB, WebSocket, TypeScript, Bootstrap, jQuery and UnderscoreJS. We believed that having complete control over the technical implementation of Bloom would allow us to deliver exactly the implementation required desired.

## Challenges we ran into

Difficulty setting up the blockchain network initially. Ensuring that all peers are exposed to each other.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We managed to get a functioning blockchain for us to store data in a decentralised way.

## What we learned

Learned a lot about the uses of blockchain and how to setup our own using programming languages we were familiar with.

## What's next for Bloom

We'd like to complete all of the requirements we outlined for Bloom one day and hopefully see if the work we put in helps to modernise and make healthcare in the future better.
